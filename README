Crud

Description
===========
I have multiple sites on multiple servers, and one development machine.
I wanted a scaffolding replacement to use as a kind of default mode
for controller and view crud functions. Useful for admin purposes.
That's what this code does.

Just kidding. But not really. Point is, this code sucks. Breaks pretty 
much every unwritten rule of proper Rails coding. I won't bore you 
with the details.

Don't bother looking in the code. As I said, it sucks.

So why post it on github? Because I couldn't figure out how to manage
this code using git with the shared codebase sitting on my local 
machine while still using capistrano to deploy. github is a no-brainer.

Someday, when this plugin code becomes beautiful, I'll write up a
proper README. But for now, just move along. :)
